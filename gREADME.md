Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. This is a recreation of the mobile version of the game from 1998 on Nokia mobile phones.

The game runs on your browser and it has been tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge.

You use WASD to control the snake and ENTER to start or restart the game.

Your goal is to collect the green-coloured food like so:
